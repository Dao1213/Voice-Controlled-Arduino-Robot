# Voice-Controlled-Arduino-Robot
This project implements a voice-controlled Arduino robot using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for speech recognition. It processes voice commands, extracts key features, and sends control signals to an Arduino Leonardo, enabling real-time robot navigation.
