# Voice-Controlled Arduino Robot ü§ñüîä  

This project implements a **voice-controlled robot** using an **Arduino Leonardo**, powered by **machine learning-based speech recognition** with **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. The system captures and processes voice commands, sending control signals to the robot via **serial communication**.

## üîß Hardware Components
- üõ† **Microcontroller**: Arduino Leonardo
- üîä **Microphone Module**: Captures voice commands
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Motors**: DC motors with a motor driver for movement
- üîã **Power**: External power supply for stable operation
- üì° **Communication**: Serial data transfer between PC and Arduino

## üñ• Software Tools
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For voice signal processing and feature extraction
- **Python Libraries**: `numpy`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, `librosa`, `pyserial`
- **Machine Learning**: **SVD** & **PCA** for feature reduction and classification
- **Arduino IDE**: For motor control firmware

## üöÄ How It Works
1. **Voice Signal Processing**  
   - Captures voice commands using a **microphone module**.
   - Converts speech into a numerical feature matrix using **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)**.
   
2. **Feature Extraction with SVD & PCA**  
   - **SVD** decomposes the feature matrix for dimensionality reduction.
   - **PCA** finds the most important features for classification.

3. **Command Classification**  
   - Trains an ML model to recognize commands like `forward`, `backward`, `left`, `right`, and `stop`.
   - Uses **KNN or SVM classifiers** for real-time prediction.

4. **Arduino Control**  
   - The predicted command is sent via **serial communication** (`pyserial`).
   - Arduino executes corresponding motor actions.
